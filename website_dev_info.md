# Website info


##### Problem:

When iCloud uploads files such as my profile picture, the website no longer works. I solved this my unchecking "Optimize Mac Storage". This prevents iCloud from removing downloads automatically. If I realize later that I need this option, I can consider adding ".nosync" to the filename of my profile picture. This will prevent iCloud from synchronization. It will still remain in the cloud via GitHub. Disadvantage: Other files could get removed as well.
